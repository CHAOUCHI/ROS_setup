# ROS_setup

A simple setup Bash script that simplifies repetitive commands with ROS when opening a new terminal.

## How to proceed without this script

When using ROS, you must enter the following commands in every new terminal:
Source the ROS setup file (replace <distro> by your distro name)
- `source /opt/ros/<distro>/setup.bash`
- `export ROS_DOMAIN_ID=<int>`
- `export ROS_LOCALHOST_ONLY=<bool>`
Then, verify that ROS environment variables are successfully set with the correct values with the following command :
- `env | grep ROS`

## Purpose of this script

Doing these is a **loss of time**. That's why I wrote this simple script that does all this actions.

## Syntax
- `setup.bash -h|--help`
- `setup.bash [-v|--verbose] [-d|--domain <ROS_DOMAIN_ID>] [-l|--localhost-only <ROS_LOCALHOST_ONLY>]`

The script can be launched with both `.` and `source` commands.

### Examples

- `source setup.bash --domain 18 --localhost-only 0`
- `./setup.bash -v -d 18`
- `source setup.bash --help`
